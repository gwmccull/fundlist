# Fundlist test app
To run the app:

1. clone the repo

2. `npm install`

3. `bower install`

4. use `http-server` (or other) to serve the project

5. `src` folder contains the source code.  `dist` folder contains the minified and uglified code

6. `karma start` to run the tests

The instructions not to put too much effort into the design but I had to at least give it a little Bootstrap styling
to make it look somewhat nice. :-)
